# Association
This assignment consists of using the bcrypt gem to have a first approach at authentication in rails. We  have built an application we call ***Members only*** that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if as a User you are logged in.

## Built with 
* Ruby on rails
* Bootstrap
* RSpec

## Live demo
https://sm-members-only.herokuapp.com/
## Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

$ bundle install --without production Next, migrate the database:

$ rails db:migrate Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

$ rails test If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

$ rails server

installing rspec
$ rails g rspec:install
